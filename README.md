## Toolkit for Data Processing & Transformations

Helix is a native Excle VBA library that lives inside of a class module. It allows you to quickly grab data from worksheets where the class module is located, or external workbooks, csv and text files.

- Easy to understand syntax
- Work with header names instead of indexes
- Easily develop data processing and tranformation pipelines 
- Send workflows to whoever has access to Excel to be reused
